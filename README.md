# Homebrew-Channel-WAD
A bunch of Homebrew Channel WADs, straight from my Wii.

How to use: Download everything and install using your favorite WAD manager (Or "Install WAD" if you're using Dolphin Emulator)
Keep in mind, some of the versions will not work on Dolphin.

Unpatched WADs will not work on 4.3 unless title ID checks are removed using Priiloader. If you do not wanna use that, use the patched WADs instead.

That's it. Bye
